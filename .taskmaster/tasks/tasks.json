Analyzed existing dependencies, noting the use of Provider, GoRouter, and Firebase instead of Riverpod. Confirmed the project utilizes SQLite for offline-first architecture, diverging from the initial plan to use Drift. Verified a clean architecture with proper separation of concerns is already implemented. Documented existing system capabilities in `FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md`. Identified missing features from PRD: barcode scanning, PIN-based authentication, and role-based access control, which will be addressed in subsequent tasks. Noted the absence of `build_runner` configuration for Drift and specific `sqlcipher_flutter_libs` integration, as Drift is not used.",
